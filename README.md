# DOTFILES

Hi, these are my current linux dotfiles.
I currently use hyprland for my wm and neovim as my ide, in neovim
some lsp servers and a python debugger are configured but more will be 
added for c/rust and others i use.
Everything is themed with everforest.
The dap.lua configuration is not present but you can configure it 
yourself in the config part of the nvim folder, guide is [here](https://github.com/mfussenegger/nvim-dap/wiki/Debug-Adapter-installation#python).
